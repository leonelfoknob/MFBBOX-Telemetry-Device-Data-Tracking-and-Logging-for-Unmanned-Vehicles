MFBBOX is an advanced telemetry device designed for real-time data tracking and logging in unmanned vehicles. Built to collect and transmit essential telemetry data, MFBBOX is a crucial tool for monitoring unmanned systems in various fields such as exploration, research, and operational surveillance. While it currently focuses on data collection, MFBBOX lays the groundwork for future vehicle control capabilities.

Key Features:
  - Real-Time Data Tracking: MFBBOX streams live data including acceleration, speed, heading, pressure, altitude, rotational angle, position, and battery information, ensuring operators
    receive timely and accurate updates.
  - Image Transmission: Along with sensor data, MFBBOX can transmit live image feeds to give operators a clear view of the vehicleâ€™s environment.
  - Data Logging for AI Applications: MFBBOX creates detailed logs of all tracked data, which can be used to build a strong dataset for AI models. These datasets can help predict path
    tracking, detect anomalies, and even forecast device failures, contributing to the long-term reliability and autonomy of unmanned systems.
  - Scalable Sensor Integration: The modular design allows for the addition of multiple sensors, making MFBBOX adaptable to a wide range of unmanned vehicle platforms.
  - Future Development - Control Capabilities: While MFBBOX currently focuses on data collection, future iterations will incorporate vehicle control features. This will allow users not
    only to track and log data but also to remotely control the vehicle in real time.
